## Essential Software Engineering Reading

Here is a **list of classic articles and books** that have informed my thinking on software engineering. This list does not include my list of (great) programming or management books, but speaks more to understanding and managing software development on a higher level - as I believe most software dev succeeds/fails before a line of code was written.

#### A note on learning:
*Almost all I know and believe about software comes from experiences and observations in delivering software, but that does not discount the value in these tomes. I typically learn a fundamental principle by first observing a phenomena in various environments, and then, when I come accross a great study or article which clearly expresses and justifies the principle I get that AHA! moment where deep understanding is formed. E.g. seeing estimation inaccuracy occur 100s of times, and then reading Don Reinersen's description of variability in product developments gave me a big AHA!.*

*Too be honest, so much in software engineering isn't obvious or intuitive and I initially miss the messages in books that were not pre-empted by my experiences (XP being a prime example).*

Here goes:

### Approach and principles:
* [The Mytical Man Month, Brooks, F. P.(1975)](http://www.amazon.com/The-Mythical-Man-Month-Engineering-Anniversary/dp/0201835959) *
* [No Silver Bullet, Brooks, F. P.(1986)](http://faculty.salisbury.edu/~xswang/Research/Papers/SERelated/no-silver-bullet.pdf)
* [The New New Product Development Game, Takeuchi&Nonaka(1986)](https://hbr.org/1986/01/the-new-new-product-development-game)
* [Extreme Programming Explained: Embrace Change, Kent Beck (1999)](http://www.amazon.com/Extreme-Programming-Explained-Embrace-Change/dp/0321278658) *
* [The Agile Manifesto (2001)](http://www.agilemanifesto.org/)
* [Agile Software Development with Scrum, Schwaber&Beedle (2002)](http://www.amazon.com/Agile-Software-Development-Scrum-Series/dp/0130676349) *
* [Lean Software Development: An Agile Toolkit, Poppendiecks (2003)](http://www.amazon.com/Lean-Software-Development-Agile-Toolkit/dp/0321150783)
* [The Principles of Product Development Flow(2009)](http://www.amazon.com/The-Principles-Product-Development-Flow/dp/1935401009)
* Lean, Scrum and XP from the Trenches
* The Art of Unix Programming, Cathederal and the Bazaar
* Silver bullet
* Waterfall

### People, Teams and Enviroments
* Drive (Daniel Pink)
* The 5 disfunctions of a team
* [Peopleware](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0932633439/) **

### Building the right thing
* User Story Mapping - 
* Lean Startup - to find out if we are building the right things often needs more than just detailed analysis, we need to experiment, but do it fast so that we don't run out of time/money.

### Building the thing right
* Refactoring - Code is design and design should be evole
* Continous Delivery
* DDD
* TDD

### Being a professional developer
* The Pragmatic Programmer
* Clean Code
* Code Complete 2
* Craftsmanship **

*Books I have to read again, because I didn't realise their significance when I read it, and therefore didn't absorb the content.

**Books that are still on my must-read, adding it here more for myself.
