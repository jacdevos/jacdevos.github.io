## Essential Software Engineering Reading

Here is a **list of classics** that have informed my thinking on software engineering. This list does not include my list of (great) programming books , but speaks more to understanding and managing software development on a higher level - as I believe most software dev succeeds/fails before a line of code was written.

#### A note on learning:
*Almost all I know and believe about software comes from experiences and observations in delivering software, but that does not discount the value in these tomes. I typically learn a fundamental principle by first observing a phenomena in various environments, and then, when I come accross a great study or article which clearly expresses and justifies the principle I get that AHA! moment where deep understanding is formed. E.g. seeing estimation inaccuracy occur 100s of times, and then reading Don Reinersen's description of variability in product developments gave me a big AHA!.*

*Too be honest, so much in software engineering isn't obvious or intuitive and I initially miss the messages in books that were not pre-empted by my experiences (XP being a prime example).*

Anyway here goes:

Process
* The Agile Manifesto
* The Principles of Product Development flow
* The New New Product Development game
* Lean Software Development: An Agile Toolkit
* Extreme Programming Explained: Embrace Change
* Extreme Programming, a Reflection (blog post)
* The Mytical Man Month
* XP
* Scrum
* Lean, Scrum and XP from the Trenches

Building the right thing
* User Story Mapping - 
* Lean Startup - to find out if we are building the right things often needs more than just detailed analysis, we need to experiment, but do it fast so that we don't run out of time/money.

Building the thing right
* Refactoring - Code is design and design should be evole
* Continous delivery
* DDD
* TDD

People, Teams and Enviroments
* Drive (Daniel Pink)
* The 5 disfunctions of a team

Being a professional developer
* The Pragmatic Programmer
* Clean Code
* Code Complete 2
* Craftsmanship

Other
Cathederal and the bazaar and The Art of Unix Programming

Books I have to read again, because I realise their significance now, but can't remember the content:
