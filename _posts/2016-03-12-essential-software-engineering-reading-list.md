## Essential Software Engineering Reading

Here is a list of classics that have informed my thinking on software engineering. This list does not include my list of (great) programming books , but speaks more to understanding and managing software development on a higher level - as I believe most software dev succeeds/fails before a line of code was written.

*A note on learning: Almost all I know and believe about software comes from experience and observations in delivering software, but that does not discount the value in these tomes. I typically learn a fundamental principle by first observing a phenomena in various environments, and then, when I come accross a great study or article which clearly expresses and justifies the principle I get that AHA! moment where deep understanding is formed. E.g. seeing estimation inaccuracy occur 100s of times, and then reading Don Reinersen's description of variability in product developments gave me a big AHA!.

Too be honest, since much in software engineering isn't obvious or intuitive, I initially miss the messages in books that were not pre-empted by experience (XP being a prime example) *
