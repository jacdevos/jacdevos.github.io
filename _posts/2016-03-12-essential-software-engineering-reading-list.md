## Essential Software Engineering Reading

Here is a list of classics that have informed my thinking on software engineering. This list does not include my list of (great) programming books , but speaks more to understanding and managing software development on a higher level - as I believe most software dev succeeds/fails before a line of code was written.

*A note on learning: Almost all I know and believe about software was from experience and observations in delivering software, but that does not discount the value in these tomes. I typically learn a fundamental principle by first observing a phenomena in a few environments, and then, when I come accross a great study or article which clearly expresses and justifies the principle I get that AHA moment where deep understanding is formed.*
