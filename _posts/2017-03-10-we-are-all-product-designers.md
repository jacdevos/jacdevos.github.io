title: What is software product design? (DevConf 2017)
---
Although software engineering has become crucial to our modern society, it is still a new and often misunderstood discipline.

One of the most harmful misconceptions is that programming and testing are similar activities to construction in mature engineering disciplines, performed after the design has been completed.

In this talk I will give the audience a fresh look at software engineering, inspired by a 1992 article by Jack W. Reeves: “What is design?” I will show how software product development is a creative, collaborative process involving the create creative energy of all the role players in a team (including UX, BA, Dev, Test, Ops).

Finally I will revisit ideas from XP (Extreme Programming) and just show how cool this software design can be when we do it together as a team.
