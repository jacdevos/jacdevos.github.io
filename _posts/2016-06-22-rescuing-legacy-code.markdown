title: Rescuing Legacy Software from Impending Doom (Agile Australia 2016)
---
Dealing with an ageing code base is one of the hardest challenges that software development teams face. Legacy code bases can slow teams to a crawl, and therefore it is critical to solve this on the road to agility. Software rewrites fail at alarming rates! Refactoring – a safer approach – has emerged as the de-facto technique to tackle this challenge.

This session we will equip attendees with techniques and lessons to help them refactor more effectively. We will share our experience gained while working with various software teams, from startups to mid-sized organisations, that attempted to rescue their legacy from impending doom.

You will learn how to justify the investment in refactoring legacy code to product owners; when and how to apply different refactoring workflows on legacy code; and practical tips to avoid common pitfalls when refactoring code.
