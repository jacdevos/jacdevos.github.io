title: Understanding software engineering with equations (DeveloperUG 2016 Talk)
---

In my work as developer coach, I noticed a few traps that most software teams step into that affect their delivery speed, predictability and quality.

In order to escape these traps, teams and managers need to understand the consequences of their decisions - they need to understand the dynamics of software engineering. This is not an easy task and we need solid help. We need maths!

In this talk I explore a few equations that describe dynamics in software engineering, which can help us see the forest from the trees. I also cover some modern practices - and show how software engineers can get back control of their delivery.

The problems addressed include:
  * Deadlocked by Dependencies: Inability to deliver due to waiting on something
  * Code-Degeneration: Code changes become more difficult over time
  * Congestion: Slow, unpredictable delivery even though we are very busy
  * Firefighting: We know what we should do, but we donâ€™t have time to improve
